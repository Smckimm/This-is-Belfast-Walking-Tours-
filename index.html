    <h2>About the Tour</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Stevie, born, bred and proud to hail from the historic and unique city of Belfast.  
      I have a passion for history, culture and notable people all of which Belfast has in abundance.  
      Having grown up with the troubles – being born in 1969 – I have the lived experience of what our city went through and how it has risen to rightly be one of the premium city breaks in the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      My tour also captures the origins of the city from the humble banks of the hidden River Farset through to rebellions, becoming a powerhouse of the industrial revolution including the most famous shipyard and ship in the world.  
      My own history is intertwined with Belfast and I will be your storyteller of this awesome city with a personal touch and the world-famous Belfast humour – the craic!  
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a tour guide is an honour with one of the best aspects being hearing your stories!  
      It’s my mission to ensure an informative and engaging experience for all with a good dose of the legendary Belfast welcome.  
      I am fully qualified OCN Level 2 and a member of Tour Guides N Ireland providing insurance cover for your peace of mind.  
      <strong>See you at the Big Fish!</strong>
