    <h2>About the Tour</h2>
    <p>My name is Stevie, born, bred and proud to hail from the historic and unique city of Belfast.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for history, culture and notable people all of which Belfast has in abundance. Having grown up with the troubles - being born in 1969 - I have the lived experience of what our city went through and how it has risen to rightly be one of the premium city breaks in the world! My tour also captures the origins of the city from the humble banks of the hidden River Farset through to rebellions, becoming a powerhouse of the industrial revolution including the most famous shipyard and ship in the world. My own history is intertwined with Belfast and I will be your storyteller of this awesome city with a personal touch and the world famous Belfast humour - the craic! Being a tour guide is an honour with one of the best aspects being hearing your stories!</p>
    <p>It's my mission to ensure an informative and engaging experience for all with a good dose of the legendary Belfast welcome. I am fully qualified OCN Level 2 and a member of Tour Guides N Ireland providing insurance cover for your peace of mind. See you at the Big Fish!</p>
