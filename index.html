    <h2>Tour Overview</h2>
    <p>"This is Belfast" is an immersive walking tour designed to introduce to the heart and soul of Belfast.My name is Stevie McKimm born, bred and proud to hail from the historic and unique city of Belfast. 
I  have a  passion for history, culture and notable people all of which Belfast has in abundance.  Having grown up with the troubles - being born in 1969 - I have the lived experience of what our city went through and how it has risen to rightly be one of the premium city breaks in the world! My tour also captures the origins of the city from the humble banks of the hidden River Farset through to rebellions,  becoming  a powerhouse of the industrial revolution including the most famous shipyard and ship in the world. My own history is intertwined with Belfast and I will be your storyteller of this awesome city with a personal touch and the world famous Belfast humour - the craic! Being a tour guide is an honour with one of the best aspects being hearing your stories! 
I can also provide a running / jogging tour for those who like a tour that burns extra calories - details on request.
It's my mission to ensure an informative and engaging experience for all with a good dose of the legendary Belfast welcome. 

I run tours Friday evening Saturday and Sunday on request.  Please contact me by phone  email at  thisisbelfasttours@gmail.com or WhatsApp  for more information </p>
